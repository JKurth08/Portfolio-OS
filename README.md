# Portfolio-OS
This is my official portfolio website! Creating this from scratch took a lot of time and effort and I am proud to say it is now completed (for now). I plan on updating it with the new projects I build. This was written in JavaScript XML using the React framework and Vite to handle the build tools and developer server.
